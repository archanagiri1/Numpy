# Reshape Array: changing its dimensions (e.g., rows and columns) without altering the actual data
# Flatten Array: transforming a multi-dimensional array into a single-dimensional array

print(reshaped2)

print(reshaped2.flatten())          # flattened array from higher (2D) dimensional (2,3) to (1,6) (1D)
